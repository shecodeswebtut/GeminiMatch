## How we built it

We built GeminiMatch using cutting-edge web development tools and **seamlessly integrated the power of Gemini AI.** This lets us process massive amounts of data to find the best deals without slowing you down.  The **Google AI documentation** was the main source of information here! We have use **REACT framework** for web development.

## Challenges we ran into

We encounter several problems over the whole duration of completing this project. **Developing GeminiMatch required us to prioritize an exceptional user experience (UX). This led to extensive discussions and refinements during the design process to ensure a smooth and intuitive user journey.**

A significant technical hurdle involved ** integrating the Gemini API data seamlessly into our application's frontend**. That took a lot of searches over the Internet and documentation. We are proud to have overcome this challenge and successfully implemented the integration

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

This is our second participation as a team in a Hackathon sponsered by Google.** We're happy that we've grown together as a team**. We learned how to work together , how to distribute tasks and how to discuss everything out. 
Secondly, we're proud that this time we have a working model of our App, which we have made with lots of efforts and dedication. 

** This Hackathon journey was wholesome as a team and as a developer!**

## What we learned

This hackathon was an invaluable learning experience. Notably, it provided **our first opportunity to work with the Google Gemini API**.  The integration process involved a deep dive into the API's functionalities and documentation, significantly expanding our technical skillset. We found this process both challenging and rewarding, ultimately achieving a successful integration.

## What's next for GeminiMatch

There are many new advancement which we are aiming to do -
1.  We aims to make it a general recommendation app with many sub-category like gadgets, clothes etc.

2.  We aims to store the data of user and provide a personalised recommendation based on recent purchase or wishlisted product!
